* ❓ What is the difference between the system, user, and assistant roles? *

Answer:
In the OpenAI chat format, every message has a role that tells the model who is speaking and how to interpret the message.

system – Defines the model’s identity, behavior, and goals. It provides high-level instructions that the assistant must always follow. Example:
“You are an AI assistant for the project AI Agent Lab. Explain it clearly and helpfully.”

user – Represents the actual input or question from the human user. This is what the assistant should respond to. Example:
“Can you explain what Stage 1 is about?”

assistant – Contains previous responses generated by the model itself. Sending these back allows the model to remember the conversation context. Example:
“Stage 1 focuses on running an open-weight model such as Mistral 7B locally.”

Together, these roles help the model understand conversation flow and maintain consistent context across multiple interactions.
